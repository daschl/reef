# reef
reef is an event-driven framework which allows you to build safe and highly
performant server application. It is (mostly) a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) port of the awesome
[seastar](http://www.seastar-project.org/) framework which is written in C++.

While the plan is to have something stable and production ready eventually, This
project is under heavy development and subject to change quite a bit. I'm experimenting
with all bits and pieces here, so expect it to eat your laundry and more.

Installation, Usage and Tutorials will come at a later point. For now treat it
like any other rust library with sucking documentation and check out the examples
and source code ;)
